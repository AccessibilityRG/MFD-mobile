# Multi-temporal function-based dasymetric model for mobile phone data

**This script is part of the following article:**

  phone data using multi-temporal dasymetric interpolation. Published in International Journal of 
  Geographical Information Science.

Programmed by: Henrikki Tenkanen, University of Helsinki, Finland.

## Purpose:
  
This script demonstrates how multi-temporal dasymetric interpolation model can be used to interpolate population distributed in spatially varying
coverage areas of mobile phone base stations into a desired layout of predefined statistical units using ancillary data sources. 

## Requirements:

Python 3 with following packages and their dependencies: pandas, geopandas.

## Data:

This script is planned to work with data that is described in the main article, see J채rv et al. (2017). In short, the script requires three datasets:
  
  1) a disaggregated physical surface layer, 
  2) time-dependent human activity data,
  3) mobile phone data (CDR), or similar. 

## Contact:

You can contact Olle J채rv or Henrikki Tenkanen if you have any questions related to the model or the Python implementation of the model:
